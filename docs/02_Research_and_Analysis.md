# 1. Career Domain Research

## 1.1 Job Application Lifecycle

### Background

To build an effective AI-powered career platform, it is essential to understand the complete job application lifecycle. Rather than focusing on isolated tasks such as resume writing or interview preparation, Hirely aims to support users throughout their entire career preparation journey.

Understanding this lifecycle helps identify the challenges faced by job seekers, the decisions they make at each stage, and the opportunities where Artificial Intelligence can provide meaningful assistance.

---

### Research Findings

A typical job application lifecycle consists of the following stages:

1. Career Goal Definition
2. Skill Assessment
3. Resume Creation
4. Resume Optimization
5. Job Search
6. Job Description Analysis
7. Resume Customization
8. Cover Letter Preparation
9. Job Application Submission
10. ATS Screening
11. Recruiter Review
12. Interview Preparation
13. Interview Process
14. Job Offer
15. Career Growth and Continuous Learning

Each stage introduces unique challenges that can impact a candidate's chances of securing employment.

---

### Analysis

The research demonstrates that the hiring process extends far beyond simply creating a resume. Job seekers require continuous guidance throughout multiple stages of their career journey.

Many existing platforms solve only individual problems, such as resume building or interview preparation, requiring users to switch between multiple tools. This fragmented experience reduces efficiency and limits personalized guidance.

A unified platform that supports multiple stages of the hiring process can provide a more consistent and effective user experience.

---

### Decision for Hirely

Hirely will be designed as an end-to-end AI-powered career platform rather than a single-purpose resume application.

The initial release (Version 1.0) will focus on the most impactful stages of the job application lifecycle:

- Resume Checker
- Resume Scorer
- Cover Letter Generator
- AI Career Coach

The software architecture will remain modular so that future versions can expand to support additional stages such as interview simulation, LinkedIn profile optimization, job matching, recruiter tools, and career development services.

---

### Key Takeaways

- The hiring process is a multi-stage journey rather than a single task.
- Users require personalized assistance throughout different stages.
- Existing solutions are often fragmented across multiple platforms.
- Hirely will provide an integrated AI-powered experience.
- Future development should continue to align with the complete job application lifecycle.

# 2. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)

## 2.1 What is an Applicant Tracking System?

### Background

As organizations receive hundreds or even thousands of job applications for a single position, manually reviewing every resume becomes inefficient and time-consuming. To streamline the recruitment process, companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), which automate many stages of candidate management and resume evaluation.

Understanding how ATS platforms operate is essential for designing AI-powered career tools that help users create resumes optimized for modern recruitment systems.

---

### Research Findings

An Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is recruitment software used by organizations to collect, organize, process, and manage job applications throughout the hiring process.

An ATS serves as the first stage of candidate evaluation before resumes reach recruiters or hiring managers. Rather than replacing human decision-making, it assists recruiters by organizing applicant information, extracting relevant resume data, filtering candidates based on predefined criteria, and simplifying recruitment workflows.

Modern ATS platforms commonly perform the following tasks:

- Collect job applications
- Parse resume content
- Extract candidate information
- Identify skills and qualifications
- Organize applicant records
- Rank or filter candidates
- Support recruiter workflows
- Track candidate progress throughout recruitment

The level of automation varies between ATS platforms, but nearly all systems aim to reduce manual effort while improving recruitment efficiency.

---

### Analysis

The research indicates that an ATS is significantly more than a keyword-matching tool. It functions as a recruitment management system responsible for processing candidate information before recruiters begin manual evaluation.

This understanding changes how resume optimization should be approached. Instead of focusing solely on visual formatting or keyword density, resumes should be designed to maximize readability, accurate information extraction, and compatibility with automated recruitment systems.

---

### Decision for Hirely

Hirely will treat ATS compatibility as an essential aspect of resume quality rather than as an independent feature.

The Resume Checker and Resume Scorer modules will evaluate resumes with ATS compatibility in mind, helping users improve not only resume content but also the likelihood that their resumes are successfully processed by recruitment systems.

Future versions of Hirely may include a dedicated ATS Optimization module that provides deeper analysis and recommendations based on ATS best practices.

---

### Key Takeaways

- ATS is recruitment management software.
- ATS assists recruiters rather than replacing them.
- Resume processing involves more than keyword matching.
- ATS compatibility should be considered during resume evaluation.
- Hirely should incorporate ATS awareness into its core resume analysis features.
